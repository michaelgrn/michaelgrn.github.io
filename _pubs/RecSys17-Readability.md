## Abstract

We present an initial examination on the impact text complexity has when incorporated into the recommendation process in community question answering sites. We use Read2Vec, a readability assessment tool designed to measure the readability level of short documents, to inform a traditional content-based recommendation strategy. The results highlight the benefits of incorporating readability information in this process.
