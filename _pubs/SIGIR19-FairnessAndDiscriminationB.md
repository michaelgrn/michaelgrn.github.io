## Abstract

Fairness and related concerns have become of increasing importance in a variety of AI and machine learning contexts. They are also highly relevant to information retrieval and related problems such as recommendation, as evidenced by the growing literature in SIGIR, FAT*, RecSys, and special sessions such as the FATREC workshop and the Fairness track at TREC 2019; however, translating algorithmic fairness constructs from classification, scoring, and even many ranking settings into information retrieval and recommendation scenarios is not a straightforward task. This tutorial will help to orient IR researchers to algorithmic fairness, understand how concepts do and do not translate from other settings, and provide an introduction to the growing literature on this topic.
