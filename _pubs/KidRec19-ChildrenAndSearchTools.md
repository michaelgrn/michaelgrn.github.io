## Abstract

As children search the internet for materials, they often turn to search engines that, unfortunately, offer
children little support as they formulate queries to initiate the search process or examine resources for
relevance. While some solutions have been proposed to address this, inherent to this issue is the need
to evaluate the effectiveness of these solutions. We posit that the evaluation of the diverse aspects
involved in the search process – from query suggestion generation to resource retrieval – requires
a complex, multi-faceted approach that draws on evaluation methods utilized in human-computer
interaction, information retrieval, natural language processing, education, and psychology.
