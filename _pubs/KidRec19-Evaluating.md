## Abstract

In this position paper, we highlight a number of issues that exist with the use of traditional metrics in evaluating recommender systems when children are the target audience. Our focus is on discrepancies that arise as a result of the differing rating behaviour of adult users when compared to children, and how these differences can warrant a reconsideration of existing assessment metrics and their validity in this context.
