## Abstract

We discuss the outcomes of the 2nd Workshop of the International and Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Children & Recommender Systems (KidRec 2018), co-located with the 2018 ACM Interaction Design and Children (IDC) Conference, which took place June 19-22 in Trondheim, Norway. The goal for this workshop was to explore research and industry efforts focused directly on or facilitating the algorithmic recommendation process for children. The diversity of attendees including K-12 teachers, educators, researchers in various areas of computer science, and industry participants-made it possible to continue to build community around this important topic and further discuss and outline the salient research questions and the next steps to promote more research in this area.
