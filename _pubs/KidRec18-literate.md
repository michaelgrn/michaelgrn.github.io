## Abstract

In this position paper we discuss a number of open problems we believe the community should address in order to enhance the recommendation task for children. We specifically outline algorithmic and evaluation limitations when it comes to recommending reading materials for children in the classroom setting. Furthermore, we focus on the need to involve an expert (e.g., teacher) as part of the recommendation process to better serve the population under study.
