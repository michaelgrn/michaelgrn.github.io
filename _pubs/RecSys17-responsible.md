## Abstract

The first Workshop on Responsible Recommendation (FATREC) was held in conjunction with the 11th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems in August, 2017 in Como, Italy. This full-day workshop brought together researchers and practitioners to discuss several topics under the banner of social responsibility in recommender systems: fairness, accountability, transparency, privacy, and other ethical and social concerns.
