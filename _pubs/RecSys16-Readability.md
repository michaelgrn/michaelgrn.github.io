## Abstract

We present an initial study examining the benefits of incorporating readability indicators in social network-related tasks. In order to do so, we introduce TweetRead, a readability assessment tool specifically designed for Twitter and use it to inform the hashtag prediction process, highlighting the importance of a readability signal in recommendation tasks.
