## Abstract

As one of the largest communities that search for online resources,
children are introduced to the Web at increasingly young ages.
However, popular search tools are not explicitly designed with children in mind nor do their retrieved results explicitly target children.
Consequently, many young users struggle in completing successful
searches, especially since most search engines (SE) do not directly
support, or offer weak support, for children’s inquiry approaches. Even though children, as inexperienced users, struggle with
describing their information needs in a concise query, they still
expect SEs to retrieve relevant information in response to their requirements. As part of their capabilities, SEs often suggest queries
to aid users in better defining their information needs. In fact, a
recent study conducted by Gossen et al. shows that children
pay more attention to suggested queries than adults. Unfortunately,
these suggestions are not specifically tailored towards children and
thus need improvement. While there exist multiple query suggestion modules, only few specifically target children. To address
this problem, along with a need for more children-related tools, we
rely on ReQuIK (Recommendations based on Query Intention for
Kids), a query suggestion module tailored towards 6-to-13 year old
children. ReQuIK informs its suggestion process
by applying (i) a strategy based on search intent to capture the purpose of a query, (ii) a ranking strategy based on a wide and deep
neural network that considers both raw text and traits commonly
associated with kid-related queries, (iii) a filtering strategy based
on the readability levels of documents potentially retrieved by a
query to favor suggestions that trigger the retrieval of documents
matching children’s reading skills, and (iv) a content-similarity
strategy to ensure diversity among suggestions.
