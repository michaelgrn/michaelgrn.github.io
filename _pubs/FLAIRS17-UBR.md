## Abstract

We present UBR, a Unit Book Recommender that combines search and recommendation into a single tool that eases the task of locating educational resources, specifically books. UBR relies on the extensive selection of books available at popular book websites and the expert knowledge archived on educational websites to generate a list of suitable book alternatives that can be readily obtained and used when teaching any unit of study. As a case study, UBR focuses on the Joy School teaching curriculum but has applications for other preschool or elementary schools that have predefined units of study.
