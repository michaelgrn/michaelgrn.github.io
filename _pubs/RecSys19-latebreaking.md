## Abstract

As part of the main program of the 2019 ACM Recommender System Conference, the Late-Breaking Results offers a unique opportunity to share with the community the latest ideas related to recommender systems. This year, we received 42 submissions for the track, out of which 13 were accepted, resulting in a acceptance rate of 31%.
