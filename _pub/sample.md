## Abstract

Personalized systems increasingly employ Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) to protect the identity of their users. In this paper, we are interested in whether the cost-benefit tradeoff — the underlying economics of the privacy calculus — is fairly distributed, or whether some groups of people experience a lower return on investment for their privacy decisions.
