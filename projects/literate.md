Teacher in a classroom with students reading about science
LITERATE (Locating Informational Texts for Engaging Readers And Teaching Equitably) is an interdisciplinary collaboration to meet teachers’ information needs in classrooms, with an emphasis on texts about current events. Our lab is using methods from information retrieval and human computer interaction to contribute to student engagement and access by developing and evaluating tools to assist teachers in finding sets of texts personalized for their classrooms. We’re working with the education department to get into classrooms and make a real world impact by empowering teachers.

This project is in collaboration with Katherine Wright in the College of Education; preliminary work is funded by a College of Education Civility Grant.
