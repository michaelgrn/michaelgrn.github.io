    recommender system, evaluation

Under this project, we are working to improve the *reliability* and *reproducibility* of recommender system evaluations.  This encompasses several lines of work:

- Research on evaluation methods, metrics, and protocols, looking to understand their behavior and failure modes.
- Development of the [LensKit software](https://lenskit.org) to support recommender systems research and promote reproducibility.

Additional, pre-PIReT work on this theme is cataloged at [Dr. Ekstrand's page](https://md.ekstrandom.net/research/reproducible-research).
