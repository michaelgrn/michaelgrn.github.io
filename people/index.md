    My name is **Devan Karsann** and I’m a first year master’s student in Computer Science. Dr. Sole Pera is my advisor and next semester I’m looking forward to starting my graduate project. I have a data set available to use and soon it will soon be time to defend the project proposal! During the school year I work 30 hours a week at AppDetex, a software startup in downtown Boise. This gives me to take 6 credits a semester and I’m happy about the balance. Right now I’m taking Introduction to Information Retrieval and Large-Scale Data Analysis and they’re both cool classes. My personal website can be found at <http://www.devankarsann.com>.
