Continuing the tradition started in 2014 to foster diversity among the RecSys community, we are happy to offer a platform where all conference attendees who identify as a female can celebrate and connect with other women in the RecSys community. The event provides an opportunity for female attendees to share the challenges and successes of women working within our community and to exchange experiences with one another.
